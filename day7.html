    <p class="info">Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
        Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
        Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we 
        have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>

    <p class="info">We start our journey through the Solar System at the center. Here we find a gigantic ball of gas so massive that the immense 
        pressure has ignited a fusion reaction. It is an average-sized yellow star known as the Sun. It is one of the most common type of star in the universe. 
        Here in this cosmic furnace, hydrogen atoms under unimaginable pressures are being fused into helium atoms, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.<br><br>
        The Sun is the largest body in the Solar System. It has a diameter of over 863,482 miles (1,390,000 km). The nuclear reactions taking place within the 
        Sun drive its surface temperature to over 10,832° F (6,000° C).<br><br>
        Although the light from the Sun seems constant to us, the Sun is far from stable. Magnetic storms and anomalies cause a number of unique phenomena. 
        Dark spots can sometimes been seen on its surface when viewing through a solar filter to reduce the light. Known as sunspots, they are actually parts of
         the surface that are several hundred degrees cooler than the surrounding areas. Tremendous flames of hot gas called solar flares and prominences shoot 
         out several hundred thousand miles into space.
